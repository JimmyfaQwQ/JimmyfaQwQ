### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Jimmyfa, a junior high student living in mainland China.
My name is a mix of my English name `Jimmy` and the Chinese pronunciation of `Popcorn Chicken`, and the 'Fa' thing can also means flowers.

### Programming languages
I use a wide range of programming languages which include Java, Python, C#, C++, Javascript and more
At the time, I'm trying to understand how the Rust things work. It's kinda confusing for me but I had started to get the core behinf it.
